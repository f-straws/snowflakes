# P5JS Snowflake sketches

This project contains write ups of the 'The Coding Train' projects:
- [x] [Coding Challenge #155: Kaleidoscope Snowflake Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3C2giDfmO8)
- [ ] [Coding Challenge #127: Brownian Tree Snowflake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUA8UREROYE)
- [ ] [Coding Challenge #88: Snowfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-mHFCGzYk)

The write ups are in Dutch, and created with a twofold aim:
- to be used within the CoderDojo's organized by [coderdojo-arnhem](coderdojo-arnhem.nl/),
- to become comfortable with `p5js` ourselves.
